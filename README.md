## Usage

Welcome to MultiStackReg v1.4!

This plugin has three modes of use:

1. Align a single stack of images
2. Align a stack to another stack
3. Load a previously created transformation file


### To align a single stack:

Choose the image to be aligned in the Stack 1 dropdown box.
Leave 'Align' in the Action 1 box.


### To align two stacks:

Place the reference stack in Stack 1's box, and the stack to be aligned in Stack 2's box.  Select 'Use as Reference' as Action 1 and 'Align to First Stack' as Action 2.


### To load a transformation file:

Place the stack to be aligned in either stack box, choose 'Load Transformation File' in its Action dropdown box. The File field can be used as a shortcut to avoid having to select the matrix manually.
